## A Giftcard NFTs (PSP34) based

_What is [PSP-34](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/psp-34.md)?_

PSP34 is Polkadot‚Äôs native **NFT standard**, designed to address ERC721‚Äôs limitations while leveraging Polkadot‚Äôs strengths.

_What is [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.brushfam.io/)?_

OpenBrush to Polkadot is what [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) is to Ethereum. A library of secure, reusable smart contracts for Ink! (instead of Solidity). It provides:

- **Pre-built Standards**: PSP22 (fungible tokens), PSP34 (NFTs), PSP37 (multi-tokens).  
- **Extensions**: Royalties, enumerable NFTs, batch transfers.  
- **Security Audits**: Community-vetted code to prevent vulnerabilities (no more reentrancy hacks!).  

### ERC721 vs PSP34

| **Feature**          | **ERC721 (Ethereum)**               | **PSP34 (Polkadot)**                   |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| **Language**          | Solidity                            | Rust (via ink!)                          |  
| **Security**          | Runtime checks                      | Compile-time guarantees (no overflows)  |  
| **Cross-Chain**       | Requires bridges (e.g., LayerZero)  | Native XCM support                      |  
| **Metadata**          | Optional (`tokenURI`)               | Built-in (via `PSP34Metadata` extension)|  
| **Batch Ops**         | Not natively supported              | `transfer_batch` (gas-efficient)        |  

#### Why Polkadot didn‚Äôt adopt ERC721

1. **Architectural Mismatch**:  
   - ERC721 relies on **EVM**/Solidity, while Polkadot uses **Wasm**/Rust. Rewriting ERC721 for ink! would be inefficient.  

2. **Cross-Chain Needs**:  
   - PSP34 natively supports **XCM** (cross-chain messaging), enabling NFTs to move between parachains without bridges.  

3. **Enhanced Security**:  
   - Rust‚Äôs ownership model prevents common ERC721 pitfalls (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflows).  

4. **Governance & Upgradability**:  
   - PSP34 integrates with Polkadot‚Äôs **on-chain governance**, allowing standards to evolve without hard forks.  

5. **Scalability**:  
   - Batch operations (e.g., minting 100 NFTs in one TX) reduce gas costs ‚Äî critical for parachains like Unique Network.  

### Cardano comparison with [CIP25](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-25)

| **Aspect**          | **Cardano (CIP25)**                | **Polkadot (PSP34)**                  |  
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| **Standard**         | CIP25 (metadata-centric)           | PSP34 (behavior-centric)               |  
| **Cross-Chain**      | Limited (requires bridges)         | Native via XCM                         |  
| **Royalties**        | Post-mint marketplace enforcement  | Enforced at contract level             |

### Implementation

The gift card smart contract enables users to lock assets into the contract through a simple transaction. Once the assets are locked, any user can redeem them.

There are two main functions:

- **Creating a Gift Card**: When a user creates a gift card, a token is minted and the specified assets are sent to the smart contract.
- **Redeeming a Gift Card**: To redeem the gift card, the token is burned, and the locked assets are transferred to the redeemer.
