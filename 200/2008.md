## A Giftcard NFTs (PSP34) base

### Implementation

The gift card smart contract enables users to lock assets into the contract through a simple transaction. Once the assets are locked, any user can redeem them.

There are two main functions:

- **Creating a Gift Card**: When a user creates a gift card, a token is minted and the specified assets are sent to the smart contract.
- **Redeeming a Gift Card**: To redeem the gift card, the token is burned, and the locked assets are transferred to the redeemer.
